/*
	 * Constructor is a type of method which has no return-type but
	 * argument-list is present.
	 * 
	 * The name of constructor is similar to the class name.
	 * 
	 * When the object is created at the compilation stage the default 
	 * constructor is created.
	 * 
	 * There are 2 types of constructor
	 * 1. default 
	 * 2. Parameterized constructor
	 * 
	 * It is a special method which is used to initialize the object.
	 * 
	 * Every time an object is created using the new() keyword, at least 
	 * one constructor is called.
	 * 
	 * If there is no constructor available in the class then that time 
	 * default constructor is called.
	 * 
	 * A java constructor cannot be abstract, static, final and synchronized.
	 
	 Constructor overloading is technique of having mor than one constructor with
	 different parameter list. they are differentiated by the compiler by help of
	 no. of parameters.
	 
	 Implicitly - Constructor Call
	   
	 Explicitly - Method Call
